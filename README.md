# **DayRider**
### **A peer-to-peer bike sharing app**


**Developed by**

 - Kat Maldon
 - Edgar Rivera



**Concept**

Bikes are once again gaining in popularity, especially in densely populated urban areas. Car traffic congestion, air pollution, and high cost of other transportation methods are only a few of the reasons driving people to look for environmentally friendly as well as economical alternatives. Small apartments don't lend themselves to longterm bike storage and most people don't ride their bikes daily, that's where DayRider comes in.
Bike owners are able to list their bikes for rent on days they won't need them and renters have access to affordable transportation. Bike shops serve as storage and pickup points in between rentals, ensuring a frictionless and safe experience for all parties.

**Application Structure**

DayRider provides an accessible and intuitive user interface through clear routing and easy to navigate menus.
